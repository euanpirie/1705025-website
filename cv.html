        <p>I was responsible for a variety of different tasks but usually I was responsible for the production of chicken and beef products. I had to ensure that the products met the quality standards that had been set by the company. I also was occasionally left in charge of the kitchen, meaning I was responsible for delegating various tasks such as sweeping and mopping the floors, making sure all surfaces were clean and ensuring everything was stocked up. I was also responsible for making sure all stock was rotated. Occasionally I would be left in charge of the deliveries as well as taking cash from customers coming through the drive-thru.</p>

        <p>I was responsible for serving food and drink on matchdays in the business hospitality lounge in pittodrie stadium. I had to take drink orders as well as serve the drinks and had to make sure that any dietary requirements were met. I had to ensure that my clients were satisfied at all times. I was also responsible for cleaning the lounge once all clients had left, as well as making sure all rubbish was put into the correct recycling bins outside of the stadium.</p>
